        <h1>Iron Man is #1</h1>
        <h2> What is the movie about?</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Stark recently helped develop Stark Industries' latest weapon: the Jericho Missile cluster bomb. When he
            boards a humvee to demonstrate the weapon in Afghanistan, it is attacked by the terrorist group Ten Rings.
            In the process, Stark is seriously injured when a bomb goes off next to him and several shards of it bore
            into his chest. Stark is kidnapped by the Ten Rings, as they want him to build a new version of the weapon
            for them. He initially refuses but, after being tortured, agrees anyway. The Ten Rings promise to release
            him when their Jericho Missile is finished, although Stark knows this is an empty promise. Stark is assisted
            in the work by a fellow prisoner, Dr Ho Yinsen. The latter mounts an electromagnet in Stark's chest to keep
            the shrapnel away from his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Stark pretends he is indeed making a cluster bomb for the terrorists, he and Yinsen work on a special
            harness powered by a miniature arc-reactor linked to the electromagnet in his chest. With Stark in the
            armour, the two undertake an escape attempt. Yinsen is killed in the process, but Stark escapes and kills
            several terrorists on his escape. He is later picked up by the Air Force.
        </p>

        <h3>Stark becomes iron man</h3>
        <p>Back in the United States, Stark announces at a press conference that Stark Industries will stop producing
            weapons. He has now seen into whose hands they all end up and does not want this to happen again. He is not
            publicly announcing the latter. Officially, he was "travelling" during the time he was kidnapped. Stane is
            only not satisfied with Stark's intention and tells him that his decision has not been approved by the board
            of directors.
        </p>
        <p>After this first act, Stark has his assistant Potts find out where else Stark Industries has sold weapons so
            that he can destroy them before they arrive at their destination. Pepper discovers during her investigation
            that Stane had originally hired the Ten Rings to kidnap and eliminate Stark. She also discovers that he
            stole the original Iron Man suit Tony had built in Afghanistan to make a suit for himself (and thus become
            the supervillain Iron Monger).
        </p>
        <p>In the film's climax, it comes to a confrontation between Iron Man and Iron Monger. Iron Monger goes down
            when Stark orders Potts to make sure the reactor at his facility blows itself up, while Iron Monger stands
            atop the building. Afterwards, Stark publicly announces that he is Iron Man during a press conference.
        </p>


        <h2>Why is the movie awesome?</h2>
        <p>I think Iron Man is really cool, because he has made his own AI that talks to him via the suit. On top of
            that he made his own arc reactor and in the desert and that powers the suit. Of course he fights bad guys
            which is SUPERAWESOME.</p>
